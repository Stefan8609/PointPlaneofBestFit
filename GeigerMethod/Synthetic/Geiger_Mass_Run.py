#TO DO: Add standard deviation points to plot, and error std to plot
#Make 4 plot with sections for each inclusion of error: make error a part of the geiger's method module
    #Make the plot modular with input noise too
#Plot observed uncertainty versus noise added
#Plot RMS contour plot
#Run 100 times to get statistical analysis of it
